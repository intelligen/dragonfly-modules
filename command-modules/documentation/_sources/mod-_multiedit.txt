
Command-module for cursor movement and **editing**
============================================================================

This module allows the user to control the cursor and 
efficiently perform multiple text editing actions within a 
single phrase.


Example commands
----------------------------------------------------------------------------

*Note the "/" characters in the examples below are simply 
to help the reader see the different parts of each voice 
command.  They are not present in the actual command and 
should not be spoken.*

Example: **"up 4 / down 1 page / home / space 2"**
   This command will move the cursor up 4 lines, down 1 page,
   move to the beginning of the line, and then insert 2 spaces.

Example: **"left 7 words / backspace 3 / insert hello Cap world"**
   This command will move the cursor left 7 words, then delete
   the 3 characters before the cursor, and finally insert
   the text "hello World".

Example: **"home / space 4 / down / 43 times"**
   This command will insert 4 spaces at the beginning of 
   of this and the next 42 lines.  The final "43 times" 
   repeats everything in front of it that many times.


Discussion of this module
----------------------------------------------------------------------------

This command-module creates a powerful voice command for 
editing and cursor movement.  This command's structure can 
be represented by the following simplified language model:

 - *CommandRule* -- top-level rule which the user can say
    - *repetition* -- sequence of actions (name = "sequence")
       - *KeystrokeRule* -- rule that maps a single 
         spoken-form to an action
    - *optional* -- optional specification of repeat count
       - *integer* -- repeat count (name = "n")
       - *literal* -- "times"

The top-level command rule has a callback method which is 
called when this voice command is recognized.  The logic 
within this callback is very simple:

1. Retrieve the sequence of actions from the element with 
   the name "sequence".
2. Retrieve the repeat count from the element with the name
   "n".
3. Execute the actions the specified number of times.
